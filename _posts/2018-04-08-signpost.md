The Signpost platform can be mounted to any sign post, harvest solar energy,
and provide the key services for their pluggable sensor modules to perform
sensing tasks. To enable multiple non-aligned sensor modules to operate within
the resource constraints of the system, Signposts meter resource utilization
and isolate sensor modules that use over their fair share.
