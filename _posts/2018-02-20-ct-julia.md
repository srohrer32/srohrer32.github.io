Worked to implement key portions of the
Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox [MIRT.jl][mirt.jl] in the Julia language.
Implemented `MIRT_fatrix2{T<:Number}` Julia type as an extension of the
`AbstractArray` interface to call shared C library code for forward (`A*x`)
and backward (`A'*y`) projection.
