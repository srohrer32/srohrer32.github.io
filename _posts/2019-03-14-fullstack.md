Built movie recommendation system with web frontend as a personal project.
Website built using Flask to interact with the Python backend and Bootstrap
for CSS styling. Recommendation system built using common
Python data processing and visualization libraries to output media content
that is similar to the user input. The entire system runs in a Docker container.
Current implementation simply picks random movies to recommend.
