**2019**

Built movie recommendation system with web frontend as a personal project.
Website built using Flask to interact with the Python backend and Bootstrap
for CSS styling. Recommendation system built using common Python data processing
and visualization libraries to output media content that is similar to the
user input. The entire system runs in a Docker container. Current implementation
simply picks random movies to recommend.
