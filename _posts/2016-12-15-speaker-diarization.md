## EECS351: Digital Signal Processing Final Project Fall 2016

Final project website for EECS351: digital signal processing. Performed
speaker diarization (splitting audio track into each distinct voice) using Mel
Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCCs) and Mahalanobis distance. Also explored
envelope features and k nearest neighbor algorithms.
