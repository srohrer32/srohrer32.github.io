title: "Novel Beamforming Approach to Stereo Sound"

## TJHSST Senior Capstone Project 2014

Designed a new beamforming approach for near-field applications (less than one
meter) to create true stereo sound. Signals were time-delayed in order to
converge on each ear of the user and create lobes of sound, instead of
creating a traditional beamforming wave-front.
